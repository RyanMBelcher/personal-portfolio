## Description

This is the first iteration of my personal portfolio web page. In its current version, it is only linking to one project since that is all I really have done thus far. It is definitly a work in progress, but I am pleased with how it has turned out to this point. It is laid in three sections, each section has a title and the main piece of the section which includes text, photos, and links depending on the section. At larger screen sizes, the title sits next to the main piece of the section and at smaller screen sizes it will all stack. This was acheived by using media queries. To get the page laid out the way it is, I made use of CSS Flexbox and CSS grid. My design was inspired by the vaporwave aesthetic. I have no design expierence and little design knowledge and did not set out with this particular design aesthetic in mind but it just sort of fell in place. 

As I move forward in my career as a web dev, I am excited to see how this project evolves and takes shape. I do not know what that might look like at this time but it certainly will involve linking my upcoming projects, tweaking the design among other things. Say tuned...
