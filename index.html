                <!-- Bob Ross ipsum!!!! But will soon need to write an about me section that is about me. -->
                <p>Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Get away from those
                    little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You can create anything that makes you happy.
                    That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put
                    dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one
                    meaning.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. These things happen automatically. All you have
                    to do is just let them happen. Let's do that again. Look at them little rascals. Be so very light. Be
                    a gentle whisper.
